<h2>About this project:</h2>

This application detects the posture by detecting the body points using computer vision.

It suggests the correction in the body posture for Yoga.

Currently it has data for 5 Yoga Postures.

<h2>Technologies used in this:</h2>

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Backend: Javascript

Deep Learning Models:
Tools and Libraries used: Tensorflow, ml5.py, pose.net



<h2>Objective :</h2>

1. To develop a modern solution for Yoga practices.

2. To motivate urban people towards Yoga.

3. To spread awareness about Yoga and exercise.

4. To recommend people the best-suited posture for their health to maintain
health and save time on process of thinking about which yoga posture they should do.

5. To guide the people to do proper postures.

6. To engage the user's interest.
